# NEPA Geeks for iOS
An iOS client for computer repair shop NEPA Geeks

## Motivation 
A friend of the company - [Jason Percival](https://twitter.com/jasonpercival) - and owner of computer repair shop NEPA Geeks reached out to us and asked to help him build a simple app for his shop. He started using a new ticketing system that gives him a bunch of `<iframes>` to drop onto his website. This app would be an additional client for them. 

The main idea being to have tablets around his shop and his various _iDropped_ partners that display his [self-checkin](https://www.nepageeks.com/self-check-in/) form for when customers arrive.
